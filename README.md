ASQ*

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Installation

install node
install watchmen
install npm

## Start the app

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

#### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup). We also recommend installing Genymotion as your Android emulator. Once you've finished setting up the native build environment, there are two options for making the right copy of `adb` available to Create React Native App:


## Writing and Running Tests

TODO setup tests

This project is set up to use [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for tests. You can configure whatever testing strategy you like, but jest works out of the box. Create test files in directories called `__tests__` or with the `.test` extension to have the files loaded by jest. See the [the template project](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/App.test.js) for an example test. The [jest documentation](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) is also a wonderful resource, as is the [React Native testing tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-react-native.html).

## Adding Flow

TODO learn flow

Flow is a static type checker that helps you write code with fewer bugs. Check out this [introduction to using static types in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb) if you are new to this concept.

React Native works with [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) out of the box, as long as your Flow version matches the one used in the version of React Native.

To add a local dependency to the correct Flow version to a Create React Native App project, follow these steps:

1. Find the Flow `[version]` at the bottom of the included [.flowconfig](.flowconfig)
2. Run `npm install --save-dev flow-bin@x.y.z` (or `yarn add --dev flow-bin@x.y.z`), where `x.y.z` is the .flowconfig version number.
3. Add `"flow": "flow"` to the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.
4. Add `// @flow` to any files you want to type check (for example, to `App.js`).

Now you can run `npm run flow` (or `yarn flow`) to check the files for type errors.
You can optionally use a [plugin for your IDE or editor](https://flow.org/en/docs/editors/) for a better integrated experience.

To learn more about Flow, check out [its documentation](https://flow.org/).

## Sharing and Deployment

TODO learn how to deploy

Create React Native App does a lot of work to make app setup and development simple and straightforward, but it's very difficult to do the same for deploying to Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store without relying on a hosted service.

### Publishing to Expo's React Native Community

Expo provides free hosting for the JS-only apps created by CRNA, allowing you to share your app through the Expo client app. This requires registration for an Expo account.

Install the `exp` command-line tool, and run the publish command:

```
$ npm i -g exp
$ exp publish
```

### Building an Expo "standalone" app

You can also use a service like [Expo's standalone builds](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/building-standalone-apps.html) if you want to get an IPA/APK for distribution without having to build the native code yourself.

### Ejecting from Create React Native App

If you want to build and deploy your app yourself, you'll need to eject from CRNA and use Xcode and Android Studio.

This is usually as simple as running `npm run eject` in your project, which will walk you through the process. Make sure to install `react-native-cli` and follow the [native code getting started guide for React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

#### Should I Use ExpoKit?

If you have made use of Expo APIs while working on your project, then those API calls will stop working if you eject to a regular React Native project. If you want to continue using those APIs, you can eject to "React Native + ExpoKit" which will still allow you to build your own native code and continue using the Expo APIs. See the [ejecting guide](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/EJECTING.md) for more details about this option.
